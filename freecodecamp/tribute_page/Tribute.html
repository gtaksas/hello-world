    <h2>How to become a dad hero</h2>
    <p> Here is how my father did it. He worked hard to give us a good quality of life. He repaired everithing that went wrong and built anything that came to mind.  He taught me everything. 
He taught me how to climb a tree. 
He taught me how to drow a car in perspective.
He taught me how to lay bricks to build strong walls.
He taught to the highway code. 
He taught me how to ride a bike.
He taught me how to drive a car.
He taught me how to hook a fishing line.
He taught me how to change a flat bike tyre.
He taught me to repair cars from A to Z.
He taught me how to make wine.
He taught me how to grafting fruit trees.
Thanks dad.

    <h2>
      My Dad
    </h2>
    <p>If I could write a story,<br>
It would be the greatest ever told.<br>
I'd write about my daddy,<br>
For he had a heart of gold. <br>
I'd write about the lessons.<br>
He taught me right from wrong.<br>
He instilled in me the values<br>
That one day I'd be strong. <br>
He taught me to face my fears,<br>
Take each day as it comes,<br>
For there are things that we can't change.<br>
He would say what's done is done. <br>
He would say hold your head up high,<br>
Carry yourself with pride.<br>
Thanks to him, I am somebody,<br>
I will never run and hide. <br>
If I could write a story,<br>
It would be the greatest ever told.<br>
I'd write about my daddy,<br>
For he had a heart of gold. <br>

    <h2>Tears In My Daddy's Eyes</h2>
    <p>
      He was always my pillar when I knew I'd fall<br>
Always my anchor, so strong and tall<br>
His hard face changes only for me<br>
His softer side, so careless and free<br>
He knows my dreams are too big for this place<br>
His little girl's leaving, ready to begin her race<br>
He knows I'll be thinking of him wherever I go<br>
I know I'm ready to do this on my own<br>
But still I cry and he holds me tight<br>
He tries to be strong, not a tear in sight<br>
I'm ready to reach for the stars in the sky<br>
He's ready to watch his princess fly<br>
It's time to let go, sure of a path to take<br>
But now I know, even pillars can break<br>
For when I drive away, trying to stifle my cries<br>
All I could see were tears in my father's eyes
    </p>
    <h2>Family Circle</h2>
    <p>
      When I am born, you are here<br>
In your eye, I see a tear<br>
Time flies and already I'm two<br>
"Look, Daddy, I can tie my shoe!"<br>
<br>
Before you know it, I'm five<br>
Every day, you thank God I'm alive<br>
Pretty soon, I turn eight<br>
You tell me I'm never allowed to date<br>
<br>
I'm already twelve in my preteen years<br>
Which means you'll help me with all my new fears<br>
Now fourteen with my permit to drive<br>
Waiting to hit the big one-five<br>
<br>
Too early comes sixteen, with my license now<br>
It went by too fast, you just ask how<br>
<br>
You want to meet my boyfriend when I'm eighteen<br>
I pray to God that you're not too mean<br>
The same guy two years later asks for my hand<br>
I'm relieved when you say, that's just grand<br>
<br>
About a year later, you walk me down the aisle<br>
Through all the tears, you bare a smile<br>
Three years later, you're gonna be a grandfather<br>
You show love and pride for your new granddaughter<br>
<br>
Another year down the road<br>
Mom dies, oh the many tears that flowed<br>
You're not doing so well without her<br>
Less than a year later, you forgot all about her<br>
<br>
Alzheimer's sets in and it scares me so<br>
Not long after, you decide to go<br>
Now I'm regretting not saying goodbye<br>
Every time I think about it, I start to cry<br>
<br>
The cycle has begun again<br>
It has started over with little Megan<br>
The other day, she turned two<br>
And said, "Look, daddy, I can tie my shoe!"

  <h3>Fathers are great!</h3>
    <p id="comment">
      Our fathers carry half of our genetic makeup. Our relationship with our father plays a huge part of who we will become. In many segments of society, people grow up without ever knowing their fathers. This is unfortunate because fathers should play as important a role in raising their children as mothers. A father is the model of a man for his daughter and she will choose a man who is like him. A father is the model for his son as well. Fortunately, there is a trend for fathers to be more active in their children's lives.
    </p>
  <h5>
    But don't forget! Hard working fathers are as good, as caring as those who got a lot of free time to take with their children and families. If not better. They take responsibility for their family. Wage slavery and other harmful social issues are another question.
